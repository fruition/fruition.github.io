## Fruition's SEO Work 
Fruition's SEO work has matured from targeting one of rankings to pushing more predicitve suggestions from Google's latest algorithim. SEO has grown far behind the basics of writing the right content and optimizing the site. It's now more analytical and takes a deep understanding of what Google want people to see. It also involves some trade-offs. Google needs clicks and eye balls to make money. Unless you're site is a massive behomouth with hundreds of millions of visits a month there will be some give and take with Google to get the best results. For example, AMP is terrible for sites profitability. Yet, Google prefers it. It's finding the balance of being highly optimize to convert visits while still getting the clicks from Google where we've excelled.
